I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Physics at Stanford University, working in <a href="https://mabuchilab.org">Mabuchilab</a>, and I am interested in AMO physics and quantum photonics in general. In particular, my primary research interest is on understanding and engineering broadband quantum dynamics of optical photons in highly nonlinear systems. 

Broadband quantum optics: ultrafast optics in strongly interacting regime
---
Traditionally, nonlinear resonators that support few strongly interacting modes (e.g., cavity QED or microwave supercondicting circuits) have been a leading platform in which theoretical and experimental explorations of quantum optics have took place. In these systems, nonlinear dynamical rate could be greater than the dissipation rate (i.e., strongly interacting regime), enabling access to exotic non-Gaussian quantum states.

On the other hand, in the field of ultrafast nonlinear optics, it is not unusual to observe an octave-spanning spectrum; An optical pulse propagating in a dispersion-engineered waveguide can trigger highly nonlinear dynamics among an immense number frequency modes, which can significantly broaden the spectrum even for a narrow-band input (e.g., supercontinuum generation).

Although both quantum optics and ultrafast optics concern the physics of the same elementary particle, i.e., photon,
